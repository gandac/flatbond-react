I have build this project for a challenge in creating a minimal ui that is doing two to a demo server.

In the UI the user can pick his desired rent amount and following some logic, he gets a price offer.

You can see the demo here [http://flatbond-5a576.web.app](http://flatbond-5a576.web.app) 

This javascript project uses React framework for providing the view skeleton,Redux for storing data, Webpack for building / creating hot dev server

Source files are in the `src/` folder and built files are in `public/` folder

Code for the two pages is in the `pages/`, and for the main actions `state/actions`

All the requirements are in `state/constants`
